/**
 * Serpent is a 128-bit 32-round block cipher with variable key lengths,
 * including 128-, 192- and 256-bit keys conjectured to be at least as secure
 * as three-key triple-DES.<p>
 *
 * Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen as a
 * candidate algorithm for the NIST AES Quest.<p>
